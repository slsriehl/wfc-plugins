//TODO: Liam -- you can write any necessary css here in normal css syntax.  don't worry about scss now unless you feel like it.  scss is a superset of css, so it will all work.  these styles are leftover from something else and I'm p sure you don't need them

.widefat {
	width: auto;
}

.ss-list-width {
	min-width: 10%;
}

.ss-form-width {
	width: 100%;
}

.ss-th-width {
	width: 25%;
}

.ss-field-width {
	width: 75%;
}
